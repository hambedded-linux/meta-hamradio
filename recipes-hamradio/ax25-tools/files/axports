# Axports  is  an  ASCII file that contains information about each of the
# physical AX.25 ports that are to be used. When dealing  with  an  AX.25
# utility  such  as  call, it takes an optional argument that is the port
# name. This port name is a reference to the line within  axports,  which
# has  that  name  as  its  first  argument. The information on each line
# contains enough  information  to  bind  the  command  to  a  particular
# physical AX.25 interface, this binding is done by matching the callsign
# on the line in axports with the callsign of the port set by kissattach.

# The field descriptions are:
#
#  name          is  the unique identifier of the port. This is the
#                name given as the port argument  of  many  of  the
#                AX.25 support programs.
#
#  callsign      the callsign of the physical interface to bind to.
#
#  speed         this is the speed of interface, a  value  of  zero
#                means  that no speed will be set by kissattach(8).
#
#  paclen        is  the  default  maximum  packet  size  for  this
#                interface.
#
#  window        the default window size for this interface.
#
#  description   a  free format description of this interface, this
#                field extends to the end of the line.  This  field
#                may contain space
