SUMMARY = "APRS Digipeater and iGate"
DESCRIPTION = "Aprx is an APRS specific Digipeater and iGate. \
It supports multiple KISS-TNCs on serial ports  and listening \
to any kernel AX.25 network interfaces. \
\
Additional features include a built-in 'erlang-monitor' to analyze \
activity level of radio channels. \
\
This software requires a valid (and unique) ham radio callsign to \
operate fully and is therefore useful mainly for licensed radio \
amateurs."

# with uclibc? See what features it needs for working correctly and set
